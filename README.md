# Snake-game
Recreation of the snake game.
In this classic snake game, you control a snake which grows by consuming apples. What i didnt realize is that in most snake games if you hit the wall the game is over. After i had already implemented my game, I discovered this mechanic, but instead of causing death, I made it so that when the snake hits the wall, it reappears on the opposite side, which turned out to be an unexpected twist in my game. However if you still hit your own tail you will die.
